This is the project
from [Android Basics with Compose](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course)
course.

You can find the app
overview [here](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-button-click-practice-problem?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcourses%2Fpathways%2Fandroid-basics-compose-unit-2-pathway-2%23codelab-https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcodelabs%2Fbasic-android-kotlin-compose-button-click-practice-problem#1).
I also added a toast for better UX.

I wrote
the [first version](https://github.com/lesyuk/LemonadeApp/commit/bb61c7c0a5f95759e0afd8d1bc05951b81bb1c9e#diff-92c27989d51fc680b56786ab9da7ed740ec6cf6938c9da99cd0b8abcbddd6c83)
of the application myself without looking at
the [source code](https://github.com/google-developer-training/basic-android-kotlin-compose-training-lemonade/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/lemonade/MainActivity.kt).
After overview the source code, I
made [some improvements](https://github.com/lesyuk/LemonadeApp/blob/test/app/src/main/java/com/example/lemonade/MainActivity.kt)
to make my code more readable and reduce code duplication.

The source code using Scaffold more complicated, I decided to built the app with basics compose
layouts, such as Box, Column, Text, Image.
